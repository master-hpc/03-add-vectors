# "Add Vectors"
Adding two integer vectors with CUDA

## Points to focus on
- from CPU to GPU code ("vector addition")
- memory management (manual)
- launching kernel (tweaking params)
- kernel configuration
- no error checking

## Compilation

      # run from repo dir
      nvcc -o out/add-vectors add-vectors.cu

## TODOs
- Translate README.md to french
